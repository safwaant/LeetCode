# Remove Element
* Two pointers: Start one pointer at the beginning of array one at the end
* Iterate both pointers until the middle of the array
* Swap values between the pointers when right pointer is != `val` and left pointer == `val`
* Move the left pointer when it is not equal to the value, since it's not in a position to swap
