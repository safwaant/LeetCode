# N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array
* Pigeon hole principle: [Wikipedia Pigeon Hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle)
* Each array mathematically can be divided into 3 length subarrays, since the minimum length an array of `2n` with `n + 1` elements can have is 3
* Check each of these subarrays and return any repeating elements
